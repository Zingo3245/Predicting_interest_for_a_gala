# Using MTA subway data to predict interest for a gala

In this project, a partner and I were enlisted to help the fictional group WomenTechWomenYes(WTWS) with a gala they are planning to hold. To recruit people, WTWS would send street teams to subways in New York City and wanted our help with figuring out which stations would be the most optimal placement for their teams.

To decide where to send different teams, we used publicly avaliable MTA data along with the American Community Survey which is part of the Census Bureau. The apporach was to target individuals with high levels of education who we thought would have higher incomes and be more interested in donating to the gala.
